https://www.elsevier.com/journals/acta-histochemica/0065-1281/guide-for-authors,"keywords</strong> <br/><br/>immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using british spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. these keywords will be used for indexing purposes.</p><p></p><a name=""47000""> </a> <strong><em>abbreviations</em></strong> <br/>define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article.<p><a name=""48000""> </a> <strong><em>acknowledgements</em></strong> <br/>collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. list here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).</p><p></p><a name=""48200""> </a> <strong><em>formatting of funding sources</em></strong> <br/>list funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:<p>funding: this work was supported by the national institutes of health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the bill &amp; melinda gates foundation, seattle, wa [grant number zzzz]; and the united states institutes of peace [grant number aaaa].</p><p></p>it is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. when funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.<p>if no funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence:</p><p></p>this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.<p><a name=""48500""> </a> <strong><em>units</em></strong> <br/>follow internationally accepted rules and conventions: use the international system of units (si). if other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in si.</p><p></p><a name=""55000""> </a> <strong><em>math formulae</em></strong> <br/>please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., x/y. in principle, variables are to be presented in italics. powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).<p><a name=""56000""> </a> <strong><em>footnotes</em></strong> <br/>footnotes should be used sparingly. number them consecutively throughout the article. many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article. do not include footnotes in the reference list.</p><p></p><a name=""57200""> </a> <strong>artwork</strong> <p><a name=""57500""> </a> <strong><em>image manipulation</em></strong> <br/>whilst it is accepted that authors sometimes need to manipulate images for clarity, manipulation for purposes of deception or fraud will be seen as scientific ethical abuse and will be dealt with accordingly. for graphical images, this journal is applying the following policy: no specific feature within an image may be enhanced, obscured, moved, removed, or introduced. adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information present in the original. nonlinear adjustments (e.g. changes to gamma settings) must be disclosed in the figure legend.</p><p></p><a name=""58000""> </a> <strong><em>electronic artwork</em></strong> <br/><em>general points</em><br/>• make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork. <br/>• embed the used fonts if the application provides that option. <br/>• aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: arial, courier, times new roman, symbol, or use fonts that look similar. <br/>• number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text. <br/>• use a logical naming convention for your artwork files. <br/>• provide captions to illustrations separately. <br/>• size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version. <br/>• submit each illustration as a separate file.<br/>a detailed <a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions"">guide on electronic artwork</a> is available.<br/><strong>you are urged to visit this site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here.</strong><br/><em>formats</em><br/>if your electronic artwork is created in a microsoft office application (word, powerpoint, excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format. <br/>regardless of the application used other than microsoft office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below): <br/>eps (or pdf): vector drawings, embed all used fonts. <br/>tiff (or jpeg): color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi. <br/>tiff (or jpeg): bitmapped (pure black &amp; white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi. <br/>tiff (or jpeg): combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi.<br/><strong>please do not:</strong> <br/>• supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., gif, bmp, pict, wpg); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors; <br/>• supply files that are too low in resolution; <br/>• submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.<p><a name=""60001""> </a> <strong><em>color artwork</em></strong> <br/>please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (tiff (or jpeg), eps (or pdf), or ms office files) and with the correct resolution. if, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., sciencedirect and other sites) regardless of whether or not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version. <strong>for color reproduction in print, you will receive information regarding the costs from elsevier after receipt

word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. however, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. when preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. if no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. the electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">guide to publishing with elsevier</a>). note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. see also the section on electronic artwork. <br/>to avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and

<br/>it is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. the text should be in single-column format. keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. in particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. however, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. when preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. if no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. the electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">guide to publishing with elsevier</a>). note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. see also the section on electronic

numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. any subsection may be given a brief heading. each heading should appear on its own separate line.</p><p></p><a name=""28000""> </a> <strong><em>introduction</em></strong> <br/>state the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.<p><a name=""29000""> </a> <strong><em>material and methods</em></strong> <br/>provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. if quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. any modifications to existing methods should also be described.</p><p></p><a name=""31000""> </a> <strong><em>results</em></strong> <br/>results should be clear and concise.<p><a name=""32000""> </a> <strong><em>discussion</em></strong> <br/>this should explore the significance of the results of

<strong><em>conclusions</em></strong> <br/>the main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a discussion or results and discussion section. do not use non-standard or case-specific abbreviations in the conclusions. this section should be able to 'stand alone' without requiring readers to refer to the text of the manuscript for explanations or definitions.<p><a name=""35000""> </a> <strong><em>appendices</em></strong> <br/>if there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as a, b, etc. formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: eq.

(b.1) and so on. similarly for tables and figures: table a.1; fig. a.1, etc.</p><p></p><a name=""38000""> </a> <strong>essential title page information",,

state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. an abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. for this reason, references should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.<p><a name=""40011""> </a> <strong><em>optional graphical abstract</em></strong> <br/> a graphical abstract is optional and should summarize the contents of the paper in a concise, pictorial form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership online. authors must provide images that clearly represent the work described in the paper. graphical abstracts should be submitted with a caption. supply captions separately, not attached to the graphical abstract. a caption should comprise a brief title (<strong>not</strong> on the graphical abstract itself). graphical abstracts should be submitted as a separate file in the online submission system. maximum image size: 400 × 600 pixels (h × w, recommended size 200 × 500 pixels). preferred

receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p><p></p><a name=""55000""> </a> <strong><em>math formulae</em></strong> <br/>please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., x/y. in principle, variables are to be presented in italics. powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).<p><a name=""56000""> </a> <strong><em>footnotes</em></strong> <br/>footnotes should be used sparingly. number them consecutively throughout the article.

thousands (10 000 and above).<p><a name=""22010""> </a> <strong><em>use of word processing software</em></strong> <br/>regardless of the file format of the original submission, at revision you must provide us with an editable file of the entire article. keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. the electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">guide to publishing with elsevier</a>). see also the section on electronic artwork. <br/>to avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.</p><p></p><a name=""25000""> </a> <strong>article structure</strong> <p><a name=""27001""> </a> <strong><em>subdivision - unnumbered sections</em></strong> <br/>divide your article into clearly defined sections. each subsection is given a brief heading. each heading should appear on its own separate line. subsections should be used as much as possible when cross-referencing text: refer to the subsection by heading as opposed to simply ""the text"". <br/>the usual main headings for research papers are: methods, results, discussion, acknowledgments and references (no heading is used for the abstract or introduction). papers should not be forced to fit into this pattern of headings, however, if they do not naturally do so. type main headings in capitals on a separate line on the left of the page. type subheadings in italics at the left of the page on a separate line, and begin the main words with a capital letter. type sub-subheadings in italics on a new line, aligned full left. start the text on a new line after subheadings and sub-subheadings. when presenting multiple experiments, authors may use main headings for the titles of each experiment, with the methods and results of each experiment listed as subheadings. try to keep subheadings short enough to fit within a single column.</p><p></p><a name=""28001""> </a> <strong><em>introduction</em></strong> <br/>state the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results. <br/>the introduction should be brief, not normally exceeding two manuscript pages. keep references to a minimum by citing reviews rather than primary research papers where appropriate.<p><a name=""29001""> </a> <strong><em>methods</em></strong> <br/>provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. methods already published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described. <br/>give the names and addresses of companies providing trademarked products. always state sample sizes (the number of animals used in the study) and the age, sex, breed/strain and source of animals. full details of testing or observational regimes should be given. if captive animals were used, include details of housing conditions relevant to the study (e.g. cage size and type, bedding, group size and composition, lighting, temperature, ambient noise conditions, maintenance diets) both during the study and during any period before the study that might bear on the results. the methods section may also contain a description of the kinds of statistics used and the activities that were recorded. <a name=""ethical note""> </a><br/><em>ethical note</em>. where ethical considerations arise from the study, these should be addressed in the methods, either in the main methods section itself (where the additional discussion is relatively minor), or in a separate subsection of the methods headed ethical note. this information (i.e. an ethical note or a summary of details given in the text) should also be uploaded separately as an 'animal welfare note' (see <a href=""#animal welfare"">animal welfare</a>. any welfare or environmental implications of the experimental design and procedures should be identified, and any licences acquired to carry out the work specified. procedures that were taken to minimize the welfare impact on subjects, including choice of sample sizes, use of pilot tests and predetermined rules for intervention, should be described. any steps taken to enhance the welfare of subjects (e.g. through 'environmental enrichment') should also be indicated. if the study involved keeping wild animals in captivity, state for how long the animals were captive and whether, where and how they were returned to the wild at the end of the study.</p><p></p><a name=""31001""> </a> <strong><em>results</em></strong> <br/>results should be clear and concise. this section should include only results that are relevant to the hypotheses outlined in the introduction and considered in the discussion. the text should complement material given in tables or figures but should not directly repeat it. give full details of statistical analysis either in the text or in tables or figure legends. include the type of test, the precise data to which it was applied, the value of the relevant statistic, the sample size and/or degrees of freedom, and the probability level. number tables and figures in the order to which they are referred in the text. <br/>means and standard errors/standard deviations (and medians and interquartile ranges/confidence limits), with their associated sample sizes, are given in the format <em>x</em> +se = 10.20+1.01 g, <em>n</em> = 15, not <em>x</em> = 10.20, se = 1.01, <em>n</em> = 15. <br/>for significance tests, give the name of the test followed by a colon, the test statistic and its value, the degrees of freedom or sample size (whichever is the convention for the test) and the <em>p</em> value (note that <em>f</em> values have two degrees of freedom). the different parts of the statistical quotation are separated by a comma. note use of italics for <em>f, p, n</em> and other variables. <br/>if the test statistic is conventionally quoted with degrees of freedom, these are presented as a subscript to the test statistic. for example: <p>anova: <em>f</em><sub>1,11</sub> = 7.89, <em>p</em> = 0.017 <br/>kruskal-wallis test: <em>h</em><sub>11</sub> = 287.8, <em>p</em> = 0.001 <br/>chi-square test: <em>x</em><sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> = 0.19, <em>p</em> = 0.91 <br/>paired <em>t</em> test: <em>t</em><sub>12</sub> = 1.99, <em>p</em> = 0.07 </p><p></p>if the test is conventionally quoted with the sample size, this should follow the test statistic value. for example: <p>spearman rank correlation: <em>r</em><sub>s</sub> = 0.80, <em>n</em> = 11, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01 <br/>wilcoxon signed-ranks test: <em>t</em> = 6, <em>n</em> = 14, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01 <br/>mann-whitney <em>u</em> test: <em>u</em> = 74, <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>n</em> <sub>2</sub> = 17, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.02<br/><a name=""31002""> </a> <strong><em></em></strong> <br/><em>p</em> values for significant outcomes can be quoted as below a threshold significance value (e.g. <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05, 0.01, 0.001), but wherever possible should be quoted as an exact probability value. departure from a significance threshold of 0.05 should be stated and justified in the methods. marginally nonsignificant outcomes can be indicated as exact probability values or as <em>p</em> &lt; 0.1. nonsignificant outcomes should be indicated with an exact probability value whenever possible, or as ns or <em>p</em> &gt; 0.05, as appropriate for the test. </p><p></p>state whether a test is one tailed or two tailed (or specific or nonspecific in the case of meddis' nonparametric anovas). one-tailed (or specific) tests should be used with caution. their use is justified only when there are strong a priori reasons for predicting the direction of a difference or trend and results in the opposite direction can reasonably be regarded as equivalent to no difference or trend at all. authors are referred to kimmel (1957, <em>psychological bulletin</em>, <em>54</em>, 315-353). <p>do not quote decimals with naked points, for example quote 0.01, not .01, or normally to more than three decimal places (the exception being <em>p</em> values for significance tests, which may be quoted to four decimal places where appropriate, e.g. 0.0001). </p><p></p><em>regressions and analyses of variance</em>. the significance of regressions should be tested with <em>f</em> or <em>t</em> but not the correlation coefficient <em>r</em>. <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> should be quoted with both regressions and parametric analyses of variance. <p><em>multiple range tests</em>. unplanned multiple range tests following anova should be avoided unless their appropriateness for the comparisons in question is verified explicitly. authors are referred to the review by day and quinn (1989, <em>ecological monographs</em>, <em>59</em>, 433-463). </p><p></p><em>power tests</em>. where a significance test based on a small sample size yields a nonsignificant result, explicit consideration should be given to the power of the data for accepting the null hypothesis. authors are referred to thomas and juanes (1996, <em>animal behaviour</em>, <em>52</em>, 856-859) and colegrave and ruxton (2003, <em>behavioral ecology</em>, <em>14</em>, 446-447) for guidance on the appropriate use of power tests. providing a value for power based on a priori tests is preferred. values of observed power are not appropriate. authors should consider effect sizes and their confidence intervals in drawing conclusions regarding the null hypothesis. <p><em>transformations</em>. where data have been transformed for parametric significance tests, the nature of the transformation and the reason for its selection (e.g. log <em>x</em>, <em>x</em> <sup>2</sup>, arcsine) should be stated.</p><p></p><a name=""32001""> </a> <strong><em>discussion</em></strong> <br/>it is often helpful to begin the discussion with a summary of the main results. the main purpose of the discussion, however, is to comment on the significance of the results and set them in the context of previous work. the discussion should be concise and not excessively speculative, and references should be kept to a minimum by citing review articles as much as possible.<p><a name=""33001""> </a> <strong><em>conclusions</em></strong> <br/>the main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short conclusions section, as a subsection of a discussion or results and discussion section.</p><p></p><a name=""35001""> </a> <strong><em>appendices</em></strong> <br/>if there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as 1, 2, etc. formulae and equations in appendices

biological nomenclature, as laid down in the <em>international code of botanical nomenclature</em>, the <em>international code of nomenclature of bacteria</em>, and the <em>international code of zoological nomenclature</em>. all biotica (crops, plants, insects, birds, mammals, etc.) should be identified by their scientific names when the english term is first used, with the exception of common domestic animals. all biocides and other organic compounds must be identified by their geneva names when first used in the text. active ingredients of all formulations should be likewise identified. </p><p></p> si or si-derived units should be used throughout (e.g. mj and not kcal for energy concentrations). concentrations should be expressed on a 'per kg' basis (w/w); however, w/v, v/v, mol/mol or m may be accepted depending on the circumstances. in addition, 'units' and 'equivalents' are acceptable. normality should be avoided, as it may be ambiguous for certain acids. if analytical standards have been used, they should be specified by name (e.g. yeast rna) and form (e.g. lactose monohydrate). percents should only be used when describing a relative increase or decrease in a response. proportions should be maximum 1.0 or ≤1.0. for more details see the editorial in vol. 118/3-4. <p> percent is <em>only</em> used to indicate relative changes. for composition, both w/w (often solids composition g/kg) and w/v (e.g. g/l), v/v (e.g. m/l), mol/mol or m can be accepted depending on the circumstances. specify units (e.g. g/l) and never as percent. </p><p></p> digestibility/metabolisability and degradability should always be expressed as a coefficient (not %), and the content of, for example, the digestible component should be expressed as g/kg: thus, the coefficient of digestibility of dry matter is 0.8, while the content of digestible dry matter is 800g/kg. a distinction between true and apparent digestibility should be made, as well as between faecal and ileal (e.g. coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility - cttad). the terms 'availability' and 'bioavailability' should be avoided without definition in context. <p> in chemical formulae, valence of ions should be given as, e.g. ca<sup>2+</sup>, not as ca<sup>++</sup>. isotope numbers should precede the symbols e.g. <sup>18</sup>o. the repeated use of chemical formulae in the text is to be avoided where reasonably possible; instead, the name of the compound should be given in full. exceptions may be made in the case of a very long name occurring very frequently or in the case of a compound being described as the end product of a gravimetric determination (e.g. phosphate as p<sub>2</sub>o<sub>5</sub>).</p><p></p><a name=""55000""> </a> <strong><em>math formulae</em></strong> <br/>please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a

forwarded for consideration.<p> to be publishable, comments and replies should be of interest to our readers: original, timely and urgent. next to this, they must be free of detectable errors. if a

(you can compress multiple figure files into a zip file and upload that in one step; the system will then unpack the files and prompt you to name each figure.) do not import figures into the text document and <em>do not upload your text or figures as a pdf</em>. complete instructions for electronic artwork submission can be found via a link on the journal home page. your figures will be tested by an artwork quality check tool; you will be asked to view the results before you can complete your submission. your figures can move into review if not up to production standards, but you should be prepared to provide better quality figures should we express interest in your manuscript.<p>the following format must be used for all submitted manuscripts:</p><p></p>-- the <em>cover letter</em> should provide (1) the category of manuscript (i.e., original report, brief clinical report, etc); (2) statement that the material has not been previously published or submitted elsewhere for publication and will not be sent to another journal until a decision is made concerning publication by annals of vascular surgery; (3) information about any personal conflicts of interest of any of the authors; and (4) names of sources of outside support for research, including funding, equipment, and drugs. the cover letter should be submitted as a separate file. any financial support whatsoever from industry must be acknowledged as a financial disclosure of all the authors in the cover. for instance, if a study is funded partially or totally by industry, this needs to be stated clearly followed by a statement disclosing whether or not each author has any financial interest in the company (etc) funding the study. it will be the editors' discretion whether or not this represents too much of a conflict of interest to warrant publication.<p>-- the <em>title page</em>, the first element of the main manuscript file, should include the full name of author, the institution from which the work originated, and the exact and complete address, business and home telephone numbers, e-mail address, and fax number of the one author who will be responsible for correspondence, galley proofs, and reprint requests. do not list academic titles on the title page.</p><p></p>-- a <em>structured abstract</em> must accompany the manuscript.

grammatically perfect. if the manuscript is written poorly it will be sent back without a scientific review. beyond this, one does not want to have marginally acceptable english and/or delivery of the information. poorly written manuscripts gets you off on a bad start with the reviewer. if the english or lack of clarity gets in the way of the science, it will be very difficult for the reviewer to have a favorable evaluation of the manuscript, no matter how good the data is. organize each section in a logical progression or order and it is a good idea to use subheadings judiciously to enable the reader to easily navigate the paper. however, a subheading should have at least two paragraphs. avoid run on sentences - if a sentence is more than 3 lines long, please re-evaluate the sentence to either shorten or break into separate sentences. carefully review each paragraph that it contains only one theme or topic and that it has transition sentences to start and end the paragraph. these are important to carry the reader from one paragraph or idea to the next. normal paragraphs should not be longer than a third of a page - if you find longer paragraphs in your manuscript, carefully edit them to see if they can be shortened and that they follow the criteria outlined above. it is always a good practice to have a colleague not involved as a co-author to edit your paper. ideally this be should somebody who knows the discipline, has published extensively and has a thorough knowledge of english. additionally you can have an agency edit the manuscript. upon request, elsevier will direct authors to an agent who can check and improve the english of their paper (before submission). please visit our customer support site at <a href=""http://service.elsevier.com"">http://service.elsevier.com</a> for more information. <p> <strong>manuscripts should be prepared with numbered lines, with wide margins and double line spacing throughout, i.e. also for abstracts, footnotes and references. every page of the manuscript, including the title page, references, tables, etc. should be numbered.</strong> however, in the text no reference should be made to page numbers; if necessary, one may refer to sections.</p><p></p><a name=""25000""> </a> <strong>article structure</strong> <p><a name=""26000""> </a> <strong><em>subdivision - numbered sections</em></strong> <br/>divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. any subsection may be given a brief heading. each heading should appear on its own separate line.</p><p></p><a name=""28001""> </a> <strong><em>introduction</em></strong> <br/>the introduction should start broadly followed by an abbreviated review of the key literature related to your research. this is followed by a short presentation of the rationale and the information gaps that the research is filling. additional justification can be that the research further develops or challenges the findings of others. this leads to clearly stated objective(s) for doing the research. summaries of experiments, methods or results should not be included in the introduction and please avoid a detailed literature survey.<p><a name=""29001""> </a> <strong><em>material and methods</em></strong> <br/>this section should give enough detail to allow a competent scientist to repeat the experiments. this should be presented in a paragraph and full sentence format - typically not in an outline or numbered format. the arrangement of materials and methods section can proceed chronologically, but normally starts with site description, followed by statistical experimental design (including number of replications) and layout, treatments, analytical methods and statistical/data analysis. for the experimental design statement please make a clear statement on the design and the number of replications which for example could start this way - ""the experiment had a completely randomized block design with four replications that had the following treatments....."" then go on and describe the treatments in detail. </p><p></p>sometimes it may be appropriate to include tables, flow diagrams, or figures to assist with the description of the research procedures, but this should be done only when absolutely necessary. maps should not be used to show research locations (rather describe nearest city, the state/province, country, and longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates in the text). maps could be used when needed to describe something in the experimental design (e.g. sampling schemes on the landscape) that can not be easily described in the text. the site description should generally include the climate, soil(s), vegetation, and any other pertinent information about the research site condition/situation. identify soils by great group name at least, and preferably by soil series name and. this should either be the fao world reference base (wrb) for soil resources or the udsda soil classification systems. information for the wrb system can be found at: <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y1899e/y1899e02.htm#topofpage"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y1899e/y1899e02.htm#topofpage</a> <p>for the usda system, as an example in the text of the materials and methods, the text can read as follows - ""the soil was a malabon silty clay loam (pachic ultic argixerolls) (soil survey staff, 2010). then cited in the reference section as follows:<br/>soil survey staff, 2010. keys to soil taxonomy, 11th ed. usda-natural resources conservation service, washington, dc.<br/> </p><p></p>for the description of the analytical methods - if the techniques are widely familiar, use only their names and give the citation that describes the method. however, any significant modification to a method should be described. for a completely new method it is important that all the details are provided. not all materials need to be identified by brand name and manufacturer. the criteria for inclusion of a particular product by brand name are based on whether it is essential to the outcome of the research, and the availability (e.g. common to several vendors). when a product must be identified by trade name, add the name of the manufacturer or a major distributor and the city of their sales headquarters, parenthetically after the first mention of the product. for specially procured or proprietary materials, give the relevant chemical and physical properties (e.g., purity, ph, concentration) (see <strong>nomenclature and units section below for more details</strong>). plants and other organisms, including viruses, insects, bacteria, and pathogens should be identified accurately at first mention by scientific name (with authority for plants) and cultivar name if applicable. all units must be in be formatted according the si system (see <strong>nomenclature and units section below for more details</strong>).<p><a name=""31001""> </a> <strong><em>results</em></strong> <br/>the results section explains the data and major outcomes using tables, graphs, and other illustrations as appropriate. this section to provides a clear understanding of representative data from the experiments. highlight major findings and special features (e.g., one quantity is greater than another, one result is linear across a range, or a particular value is optimum). avoid the repeating the details that are already clear from an examination of the graphics or tables.</p><p></p><a name=""32001""> </a> <strong><em>discussion</em></strong> <br/>it is possible to have a single results and discussion section. if you do this, it is generally best to present one set of data (which could be delineated by a short descriptive subheading) that is followed by discussion as outlined below. whether there should be two separate sections or not is driven by the data. sometimes there are very distinct subset of data that can be presented and then discussed independent of the other sub data sets or topics. if this is the case then a single results and discussion section might be most appropriate. on the other hand if the data is interrelated and can be synthesized in to single progression discussion then it is likely best to have a separate discussion section. the discussion component's primary role is to interpret the results by exploring the significance and novel aspects of the work but should not repeat results. the discussion should be driven by the rationale, objectives or hypothesis presented in the introduction. explain the principles, relationships, and generalizations that can be supported by the results or outcomes. it is important that your interpretation and explanations be based on your experiments and not go beyond what can be concluded from the data. it is important to acknowledge exceptions, anomolies, or findings that run counter to the literature - sometimes these can be the most significant outcome and result in a paradigm shift. explain how the results relate to previous findings, whether in support, contradiction, or simply provide new data. on the other hand, avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature. scientific speculation is encouraged but must be acknowledged and should be reasonable and based an the extension of your observations. often the discussion can include suggestions for further investigation. present conclusions, supported by a summary of the evidence.<p><a name=""33000""> </a> <strong><em>conclusions</em></strong> <br/>the main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a discussion or results and discussion section.</p><p></p><a name=""35000""> </a> <strong><em>appendices</em></strong> <br/>if there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as a, b, etc. formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: eq. (a.1), eq. (a.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, eq. (b.1) and so on. similarly for tables and figures: table a.1; fig. a.1, etc.<p><a name=""38001""> </a> <strong><em>essential titel page information</em></strong> <br/>•<em><strong>title.</strong></em>

the article's content and avoid words such as 'effect of' or 'influence of.' keep titles free of nonstandard abbreviations, chemical formulas, outdated terminology or proprietary names. use common names of crops and chemicals. if no common name is available for a plant or microorganism has no common name then the scientific name (with authority) may be used in the title.</p><p></p><a name=""39001""> </a> <strong><em>abstract</em></strong> <br/>a journal abstract has two typical uses. one is to help readers decide whether they should delve into the whole paper and the second is for key words for indexing services and literature search engines. a concise and factual abstract that can stand alone is required. an informative abstract must be a paper in miniature that must include: introductory statement of the rationale and objectives or hypotheses, brief description of materials and methods, results and conclusions. the abstract should call attention to new techniques, observations, or data. references should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.<p><a name=""40010""> </a> <strong><em>graphical abstract</em></strong> <br/>although a graphical abstract is optional, its use is encouraged

horizontal line. <br/> equations should be numbered serially at the right-hand side in parentheses. in general only equations explicitly referred to in the text need be numbered. <br/> the use of fractional powers instead of root signs is recommended. also powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. <br/> levels of statistical significance which can be mentioned without further explanation are: <sup>*</sup>p &lt;0.05, <sup>**</sup>p &lt;0.01 and <sup>***</sup>p &lt;0.001. <br/> in chemical formulae, valence of ions should be given as, e.g., ca<sup>2+</sup>, not as

figure must be submitted on a separate page. supply captions separately, not attached to the figure at the end of the file on a separate page. a caption should comprise a brief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration, captions should explain the data rather than discuss the results of the data. the illustration should be self-explained and be able to stand alone. therefore, the description should be clear and as complete as possible (i.e. use full species names). where needed, you may refer to other relevant tables or figures, and consider referring to the text only when the description is too long. keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used. do not use figures that duplicate information in tables. use font sizes and line weights that will reproduce clearly and accurately. keep in mind that published figures will be much smaller than your manuscript form. avoid screening and/or shaded patterns often do not reproduce well; whenever possible, use black lines on a white background in place of shaded patterns. color figures are acceptable and are the default of the electronic version but this could result in additional surcharges. use distinct symbol shape for each treatment, not just the differing a change in line thickness or type to differentiate between data.<p><a name=""64000""> </a> <strong><em>figure captions</em></strong> <br/>ensure that each illustration has a caption. supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. a caption should comprise a

used.</p><p></p><a name=""67001""> </a> <strong><em>tables</em></strong> <br/><p>each table must be submitted on a separate page. number tables consecutively in accordance with their first appearance in the text. the titles of tables should be clear and as complete as possible to enable proper understanding of what the table is presenting. similar to figures, the tables must be self-explanatory and be able to stand alone, including the use of full species names. always use your word processor's (ms word is preferred) table feature so that you have defined cells for most if not all entries. do not create tables by using the space bar and/or tab keys. separate data horizontally with a new row in the body of the table, not with the enter key. where needed, you may refer to other tables or figures that contain relevant information relevant, and consider referring to the text only in the event that the title becomes too long. do not duplicate information that is presented in charts or graphs. </p><p></p>place footnotes to tables and figures below the table body or the figure, and indicate them with superscript symbols. use the following symbols for footnotes in the order shown: †, ‡ ,§, #, ††, ‡‡, etc. the symbols *, **, and *** are always used to show statistical significance at the 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 level, respectively, and are not used for other footnotes. do not use letters as these are reserved for showing the statistical results for multiple means separation analyses. <p>vertical lines should never be used in a table. there generally should only be 3 horizontal lines in a table, one at the bottom just below the last row of data and 2 at the top that separates the headers from the body. when a header covers 2 or more subheadings (or columns of data) there should be spanner (line) beneath the heading that spans the subheadings it represents. units belong in a row of their own, just beneath the column headings, or in row headings. see below a template for how tables should be constructed. be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in tables do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article. here is a template for the layout of tables: </p><p></p> table x. table titles should be written in words and sentences that are understandable to someone who has not read the text. the table below shows the main components of a typical table. <br/> <br/> <img alt=""table sample"" src=""http://1.elscdn.net/promis_images/apsoil_table.jpg""/> <br/> *significant at the 0.05 probability level. <br/> **significant at the 0.01

can properly identify it as a data reference. the [dataset] identifier will not appear in your published article.</p><p></p><a name=""72000""> </a> <strong><em>references in a special issue</em></strong> <br/>please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same special issue.<p><a name=""72500""> </a> <strong><em>reference management software</em></strong> <br/>most elsevier journals have their reference template available in many of the most popular reference management software products. these include all products that support <a href=""http://citationstyles.org"">citation style language styles</a>, such as <a href=""http://www.mendeley.com/features/reference-manager"">mendeley</a> and <a href=""http://www.zotero.org/"">zotero</a>, as well as <a href=""http://endnote.com/downloads/styles"">endnote</a>. using the word processor plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template when preparing their article, after which citations and bibliographies will be automatically formatted in the journal's style. if no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this guide.</p><p></p><a name=""72900""> </a> <strong><em>reference formatting</em></strong> <br/>there are no strict requirements on reference formatting at submission. references can be in any style or format as long as the style is consistent. where applicable, author(s) name(s), journal title/book title, chapter title/article title, year of publication, volume number/book chapter and the pagination must be present. use of doi is highly encouraged. the reference style used by the journal will be applied to the accepted article by elsevier at the proof stage. note that missing data will be highlighted at proof stage for the author to correct. if you do wish to format the references yourself they should be arranged according to the following examples:<p><a name=""73000""> </a> <strong><em>reference style</em></strong> <br/><em>text:</em> indicate references by number(s) in square brackets in line with the text. the actual authors can be referred to, but the reference number(s) must always be given. <br/>example: '..... as demonstrated [3,6]. barnaby and jones [8] obtained a different result ....' <br/><em>list:</em> number the references (numbers in square brackets) in the list in the order in which they appear in the text. <br/><em>examples:</em> <br/>reference to a journal publication: <br/>[1] j. van der geer, j.a.j. hanraads, r.a. lupton, the art of writing a scientific

subsection may be given a brief heading. each heading should appear on its own separate line.</p><p></p><a name=""28000""> </a> <strong><em>introduction</em></strong> <br/>state the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.<p><a name=""29000""> </a> <strong><em>material and methods</em></strong> <br/>provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. if quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. any modifications to existing methods should also be described.</p><p></p><a name=""30000""> </a> <strong><em>theory/calculation</em></strong> <br/>a theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the introduction and lay the foundation for further work. in contrast, a calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.<p><a name=""31000""> </a> <strong><em>results</em></strong> <br/>results should be clear and concise.</p><p></p><a name=""32000""> </a> <strong><em>discussion</em></strong> <br/>this should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. a combined results and discussion

may be presented in a short conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a discussion or results and discussion section.</p><p></p><a name=""35000""> </a> <strong><em>appendices</em></strong> <br/>if there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as a, b, etc. formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: eq.

help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).</p><p></p><a name=""48200""> </a> <strong><em>formatting of funding sources</em></strong> <br/>list funding sources in this standard way

with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., x/y. in principle, variables are to be presented in italics. powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).<p><a name=""56000""> </a> <strong><em>footnotes</em></strong> <br/>footnotes should be used sparingly. number them consecutively throughout the article. many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article. do not include footnotes in the reference list.</p><p></p><a name=""57200""> </a> <strong>artwork</strong> <p><a name=""57500""> </a> <strong><em>image manipulation</em></strong> <br/>whilst it is accepted that authors sometimes need to

name=""22000""> </a> <strong><em>use of word processing software</em></strong> <br/>it is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. the text should be in single-column format. keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. in particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. however, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. when preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. if no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. the electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">guide to publishing with elsevier</a>). note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. see also the section on electronic artwork. <br/>to avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check'

text should be in single-column format. keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. in particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. however, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. when preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. if no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. the electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication"">guide to publishing with elsevier</a>). note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. see also the section on electronic artwork. <br/>to avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and

to existing methods should also be described.<p><a name=""30000""> </a> <strong><em>theory/calculation</em></strong> <br/>a theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article

""	non-linear adjustments to density (e.g. changes to gamma settings) must be disclosed in the figure legend. ""	backgrounds should be grey and not white or black, so as not to mask additional bands. ""	where images of gels or blots are cropped, a minimum of at least three band widths should be maintained above and below the cropped bands. ""	where images in figures have been cropped or adjusted in density, the original unadjusted images with a complete legend should be made available on request to referees and editors, who may require that they be included in supplementary material. ""	suitable controls, including molecular weight markers, must be shown on all images of gels and blots, and controls should be run on the same gel as the samples. ""	the grouping of bands originating from different blots or gels in a single figure panel is strongly discouraged, and should be employed only when the nature and scale of the experiment make such grouping necessary. it must be made explicit in the figure legend. when figures show non-adjacent bands from the same or different blots or gels, this should be clearly indicated by white spaces or vertical lines, and the original complete image or images should be made available on request to referees and editors, who may require them to be included in supplementary material.</p><p></p><a
